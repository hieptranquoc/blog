## Once upon a time...

From day one, we set up company blog to share things along the Teracy journey. You can check the blog
posts at http://blog.teracy.com

From day one, we needed a brand (logo, the color scheme for the brand, etc.) and we're still
improving it. We did not have any revenue at that time but we cared and we did this from day one.

From day one, we set up social media accounts (like twitter, facebook, etc)

From day one, we set up public github organization account to create, work and collaborate on open
source projects.

From day one, @hoatle talked a lot about #teracy on his personal account, on company facebook account
and regularly updated blog posts.

From day one, we wanted to send our messages (about our vision, our culture, our goal, our
philology, etc) to the public so that we could create a good Teracy brand in their mind. A good brand
conveys trust and by trust, we could do anything.

It is time for everyone to do PR activities together, to share the work, to share the moment together.
Especially, for everyone to show your skill. This is your chance.

## So what's actually PR...?

In short, PR (Public Relations) is the way to us (Teracy) to communicate with the public and media.
This is two-way communication, we want to send our messages and we get the feedback from the public
and media.

## Why PR...?

Because we want to listen and to be heard from the public and media.

Because we want to send Teracy messages related to our vision, mission and core values.

Because we want more people to know about Teracy brand. They will become our potential customers and
partners in the future. These people could be potential candidates to join the team, too. This is a
very effective way for recruiting.

Because we want more and more people to know about our open source projects, to use and to collaborate
on these projects. So that our company is becoming a better open source friendly company or even
become an open source company.

There are more reasons, you name it.

## How to do PR...?

Read books and apply. Leverage **growth hacking**.

Use social media channels to communicate: blog, Youtube, Facebook, G+, Instagram, Github, etc.

We (Teraciers) communicate and share our messages to different channels.

We **NEVER SPAM**, please. We share our message with honesty, with our hearts. Don't just copy and
paste and say that it's done. This is not the way for us to do so. This is creating a mess. If we're
giving good messages with bad behavior, we do more harm than help. Let's repeat: Never ever do
anything with bad behavior even with good attention. Everyone will hate us.

Be excellent with PR, let's create content that people love and want to share.

## Who to do PR...?

Everyone should and must be involved.

We need a leader to make this happen, to handle media crisis if any, to send official Teracy messages,
and to communicate with the public and media.

## When to do PR...?

Now and start now.

## Channels...?

We use social media channels to communicate. These channels are:

- blog: we should focus a lot on this. We need to do SEO better and better. Create better content for
  better engagement.

- Youtube: our videos to be shared (about us, about our tools, about our process, about our workflow,
  about our projects, about our products, etc).

- Github: our open source culture shown here.

- Facebook: our content from the blog, youtube channels should be shared here. And we should create
  facebook status, too.

- G+: mostly to share the content from the blog, youtube channels.

- Instagram: our photos should be shared here.

- Twitter: to share original content and update messages when necessary.

- Dribble, Behance: Our designs should be shared here.
