    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Docker is great to work with, it solves a lot of problems on development, distribution, and production
deployment.</p>

<p>Why Docker?  You can find the answer here: <a href="https://blog.codeship.com/why-docker/">https://blog.codeship.com/why-docker/</a></p>

<p>Docker works great on Linux, however, it&rsquo;s very challenging to make it work universal and consistent on
Mac and Windows. There are lots of efforts to solve this problem, from Docker themselves and from
Docker community, too. However, we haven&rsquo;t achieved that stage yet (until <code>teracy-dev</code>).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>These are some of the problems that Docker community has to deal with on Mac and Windows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No consistent universal development environment and workflow on Linux, Windows, Mac. This is a very
important factor for team collaboration so that anyone from any OS platforms could collaborate and help
each other with no differences in the development environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Mounted volumes on VirtualBox use vboxsf, which is extremely slow. This is true for Boot2Docker and
Vagrant default file sync mechanism on Virtualbox.</p></li>
<li><p>Native Docker applications offered by Docker:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow on Mac: <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77">https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77</a></li>
<li>Only recent latest versions of Window 10 (&ldquo;Build 10586 or later&rdquo;) are supported</li>
<li>Slow on Windows: <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/188">https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/188</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>File watching is broken on VirtualBox since vboxsf does not trigger the inotify file watching
mechanism. <code>nodemon</code>, hello?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are a lot of Docker community projects trying to solve those problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev">https://github.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant">https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy">https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leighmcculloch/docker-unison">https://github.com/leighmcculloch/docker-unison</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gansbrest/hodor">https://github.com/gansbrest/hodor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs">https://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs</a></li>
<li>others&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>However, those existing projects do not really resolve all the problems or do not reflect
our vision for a productive development platform.</p>

<p>You can check out our <a href="/2016/08/19/teracy-dev-vision/">vision for teracy-dev</a> for such the
productive development platform.</p>

<p>That is the reason why we created <code>teracy-dev</code>. We&rsquo;ve been using and loving it for more than 3 years
and counting.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> reflects our vision for a truly universal productive development platform that anyone can
use to develop software easily. It&rsquo;s very easy to customize any OS that you can use
for your VM. It brings development and production environment closer and closer.</p>

<p>It is very important for a distributed team like us to work with everyone from different teams all
over the world on different projects with different stacks and <code>teracy-dev</code> helps us a lot.</p>

<p>Moreover, <code>teracy-dev</code> is not tightly coupled with anything, you&rsquo;re free to choose anything to build
up your development VM machine. You can choose different OS platforms, choose different software packages to
be automatically installed with the help of different configuration management tools. It&rsquo;s up
to you to choose anything other than default settings.</p>

<p>With default settings, <code>teracy-dev</code> chooses Ubuntu as the base OS with <code>docker</code> and <code>docker-compose</code>
installed to start developing software with Docker right away after <code>$ vagrant up</code>.</p>

<p>teracy-dev v0.5.0 is leveraging Docker for development as we believe in the future of containers
and Docker.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have some comparisons between <code>teracy-dev</code> and other solutions:</p>

<table>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>‚úÖ: fully support</p>

<p>‚ùå: no or partial support</p>

<p>üö´: can be achieved but not encouraged</p>

<p>Let me explain the criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;same workflow on Linux, Mac, Windows&rdquo;: the usage should be the same on Mac, Linux, Windows.
Docker native app only supports >= Windows 10, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s marked as ‚ùå.</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;native speed on mounted volumes&rdquo;: the speed should be as fast and native as on Linux</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;2-way file sync&rdquo;: for syncing back and forth on mounted volumes, this is mandatory for development</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;file watching (inotify)&rdquo;: for auto reload when files change</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;customization&rdquo;: you have full control and are encouraged to change anything that you want to
suit your need, no hidden stuff, no lock-in and can still upgrade seamlessly.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see what the same workflow means when developing a simple hello world <code>nodejs</code> application
from scratch with teracy-dev by watching the following videos:</p>

<p>On Linux (Ubuntu):</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ze8p9imprgk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>On Windows:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2200zvxIdAs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>On macOS:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF-FQQKG8PA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>They all contain the same steps, that&rsquo;s the meaning of the &ldquo;same workflow&rdquo;.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> is not perfect, though. There are some improvements that we&rsquo;d like to address.</p>

<p>The first thing we&rsquo;d like to improve is to reduce the setup time. It takes time (around 20-30 mins)
to download the vagrant box (Ubuntu 16.04) for the first time. This is for the first time only, however.
After the first time, you can destroy and provision the same VM within some minutes. We could use
some other smaller boxes (for example, boot2docker base box) but we&rsquo;d like to stick to the most popular
Linux OS that is widely used in production. We try to make development and production environment as
close as possible. This is by default, you can choose different base boxes as you wish.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> v0.5.0 is under preview stage, we need to add more documentation and get more community
feedback.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> is created to give back to open source community as we learn and get a lot from our amazing
open source community.</p>

<p>And we need you, please try and let us know your feedback and we&rsquo;ll together fix any problems.</p>

<p>You should get started with <code>teracy-dev</code> here: <a href="http://dev.teracy.org/docs/develop/getting_started.html">http://dev.teracy.org/docs/develop/getting_started.html</a></p>

<p>In summary, <code>teracy-dev</code> brings <code>Docker</code> closer to <code>Vagrant</code> = love.</p>

<p>Thank you and happy hacking with <a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/dev">teracy-dev</a>!</p>

    <updated>2016-08-19T16:27:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.teracy.com/2016/08/19/teracy-dev-vision</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>teracy-dev has been being developed and in use from the first days of Teracy, it&rsquo;s been
about 3 years<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> now. We&rsquo;re in a hurry for a really big, exciting release for the next version of
teracy-dev. I&rsquo;d like to take this chance to share with you about teracy-dev vision first and many
other new features and improvements for the next long awaiting teracy-dev release.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Let&rsquo;s get started with a story about my first working days as a developer when joining my first
company 8 years ago. As developers, it&rsquo;s expected that we should have our development environment
ready before starting coding. At that time, my company used Maven to build Java projects and I was
required to install it. However, as a junior, I had difficulties to install it on the Ubuntu
computer provided to me. I struggled with it for nearly a day and eventually I had to ask for
help to install it successfully. This is a true story. Now I can even install it in just some
minutes with a few lines of commands because I have more experience.</p>

<p>Now just imagine what if juniors don&rsquo;t have to set up these boring tools each by each but just enjoy
coding, that&rsquo;s the more fun part. What if all developers should have the same development environment
even they use different kinds of operating systems so that we don&rsquo;t have to deal with the very common
problem: &ldquo;But it works on my machine&rdquo;. What if the production environment is easily set up exactly
the same on a developer machine to debug and fix things and vice versa?</p>

<p>These what ifs lead us to use <code>vagrant</code> as the base to complete these things as the first days of
Teracy journey. We&rsquo;d like to upgrade the vagrant dev environment easily, for example, <code>$ git pull</code>
then <code>$ vagrant reload --provision</code> and you&rsquo;re done. We have default configuration and we could
override it easily. We&rsquo;d like to use this development environment for all our projects: from our
internal projects to our clients' projects.</p>

<p>We created teracy-dev to solve the mentioned problems above, help boost our productivity and it could
even help us more than that. Everyone just enjoys it, we don&rsquo;t have to deal with installing things
manually, it&rsquo;s auto provided with just one command (<code>$ vagrant up</code>) thanks to the provision software.
We&rsquo;re using Chef to provision but we can use others to provision, too, for example Ansible, Puppet, etc.</p>

<p>We see that teracy-dev is so useful for developers, so we&rsquo;d like to share it, shape its future
together with anyone who wants to work with software. And we envision teracy-dev with the following
statement:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>teracy-dev is the best universal development tool for everyone.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s our vision for teracy-dev as the base development platform and we&rsquo;re going to make it true.
Note that it should be used for everyone, even with our QA engineers, with our manual testers, with
our employees, with our users as long as they follow exactly a little setup instruction guide.</p>

<p>I believe that everyone should use it as much as we enjoy using and developing it. It&rsquo;s been saving
us and our clients a lot of money as we don&rsquo;t have to spend the time to set up development environment
for each and every project manually.</p>

<p>We improve it day by day though our projects, we listen to our developers, our clients for feedback
on usage and development. However, we still have some problems with it. For example, on Windows, the
file sharing system is really slow. It&rsquo;s not really lightweight and modular enough to serve every
project&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<p>We know all these problems and we&rsquo;re going to fix these all with the next version by leveraging
Docker and Rsync. We intended to use Docker for long, we expected it should be in use since
teracy-dev v0.4.0 but we failed to make it. Now we promise you that teracy-dev v0.5.0 will leverage
Docker as the core workflow and it will rule the world of developers.</p>

<p>We will add more documentation for usage, accelerate the development pace so that you should benefit
from it as we do. Let&rsquo;s try using it once with
<a href="http://dev.teracy.org/docs/0.4.2/getting_started.html">teracy-dev v0.4.2</a>, it&rsquo;s open source and
totally free. You will love it as we do now for 3 years and counting. Let&rsquo;s together make it better
and better and better.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.teracy.com/2015/09/03/how-to-make-jwt-requests-with-httpie-jwt-auth-plugin/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-03T11:33:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.teracy.com/2015/09/03/how-to-make-jwt-requests-with-httpie-jwt-auth-plugin</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Teracy, we embrace JWT (JSON Web Tokens)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  for REST APIs to make secure requests. Just for
your information: &ldquo;JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing
claims securely between two parties&rdquo;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We&rsquo;re using JWT for our REST APIs basing on the flask-boilerplate<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> project that are empowering
our clients' web applications and our internal projects.</p>

<p>And to test REST APIs, we&rsquo;re using a really simple powerful http client called httpie<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> .</p>

<p>To make a JWT request with <code>httpie</code>, you need to use the following command:</p>

<p><code>
$ http example.org Authorization:'Bearer jwt_token_here'
</code></p>

<p>Hower, typing <code>Authorization</code> with the exact value format is a bit hard and error-prone, that&rsquo;s the
reason why we created <a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/httpie-jwt-auth">httpie-jwt-auth</a> plugin with the first v0.1.0 release. After installing
<code>httpie-jwt-auth</code>, you could use this instead:</p>

<p><code>
$ http --auth-type=jwt --auth=jwt_token_here: example.org
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s really easy to use for any JWT requests with <code>httpie</code>.</p>

<p>Please note that colon character at the end of <code>jwt_token_here</code>, we&rsquo;re going to work on removing
the redundant colon character with: <a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/httpie-jwt-auth/issues/3">https://github.com/teracyhq/httpie-jwt-auth/issues/3</a></p>

<p>Hope that you&rsquo;ll like it and use it as much as we do.</p>

<p>Happy developing and debugging!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.teracy.com/2015/07/22/teracy-birthday-slack-bot/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-22T09:19:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.teracy.com/2015/07/22/teracy-birthday-slack-bot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/2015/07/22/teracy_birthday_slack_bot.png" title="Teracy happy birthday Slack bot" ></p>

<p>Getting everything automated is one of my daily tasks, such as running tests automatically each time
there is a new commit, packaging products and sending them to customers, or deploying the
staging/ production servers when a project manager releases a new version, and more.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Today my task is something quite different: Congrats team members on their birthdays automatically
by the data got from Google calendar. After a little search, there are many automation solutions to
do it: from commercial Zapier, IFFT to opensource like Huginn.
I want something simple to use, maintenance-free, and free for small usage, so my last
choice is Zapier. It has already had the recipe<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to read events from Google calendar and another
action to interactive with Slack that will be easy to start (although the document of the recipe
is not quite clear for a new user like me). Here is the recipe for Zapier:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2015/07/22/Zapier_recipe_config.png" title="Zapier recipe config" ></p>

<p>With this recipe, Zapier will notify to the #_general slack channel with the message got from the
calendar description at the time of the event start. To make thing more interesting, I want to
attach a birthday cake image which has an employee name on it along with the message so I use PHP GD
to show a dynamic birthday cake taking the employee name from the calendar title and add it to the
image. It took me 30 minutes to get the birthday cake image which has space for the text, choose a
font and add it to my script. Finally, uploading it to our server and here is the result:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2015/07/22/cake_sample.png" title="Birthday cake" ></p>

<p>This PHP script<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> along with the Zapier recipe above makes the birthday reminder more interesting.
What I&rsquo;m thinking now is some funny fortune teller texts which are added randomly to the cake, a
lucky draw game for the team members to pick up their birthday gift and hopefully some online
merchants will open their API for our script to bring the gift to our team members' homes.</p>

    <updated>2015-05-22T09:19:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.teracy.com/2015/05/22/teracy-dev-v0-4-0-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 1 year 8 months ago we announced the <code>teracy-chef</code> v1.0.0 release<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> with a plan to extend
it for <code>teracy-dev</code>. And today we&rsquo;re very happy to announce <code>teracy-dev</code> v4.0.0 release, a really
important release we&rsquo;ve been waiting for after nearly 2 years of development. Why is it so
important?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Easy Setup And Time Saving</h2>

<p>Traditionally, setting up a development environment takes a lot of time to install the required
packages and it also requires skillful developers to do it. Now with <code>teracy-dev</code>, its mission
is to be an <code>all in one development environment managed by Vagrant and provisioned by Chef</code>.
It&rsquo;s easy and cheap to install the same development environment on all types of operating
systems (Linux, Mac, Windows) by just following some simple steps with a clear guide<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>All In One Development Environment</h2>

<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s just a few minutes to configure and enable these components to use right away.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re using <code>teracy-dev</code> everyday for all our clients' projects and our internal projects with a
wide range of technology stacks and <code>teracy-dev</code> makes our lives (trainees, QA engineers, designers,
developers) easier to collaborate.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>You could customize <code>teracy-dev</code> by overriding the default configuration on the
<code>vagrant_config.json</code> file<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> such as:</p>

$ vagrant box update
</code></p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> v0.4.0 introduced a breaking change of configuration for the VM&rsquo;s network<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>,
so you need to adjust it on your <code>vagrant_config_override.js</code> if you&rsquo;re overriding it.</p>

<p>Then:</p>

<p><code>
$ vagrant destroy
$ vagrant up
</code></p>

<p>And you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to back-port some stuff from <code>teracy-dev</code> to <code>teracy-chef</code> to make it modular so
that everyone could leverage <code>teracy-chef</code> to setup their own development environment like we&rsquo;re
doing for <code>teracy-dev</code> such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>LAMP stack only</li>
<li>Java stack only</li>
<li>Ruby stack only</li>
<li>Node.js stack only</li>
<li>Ruby stack only</li>
</ul>


<p>The possibilies are limitless for everyone to create their own baseboxes.</p>

<p>By the next versions of <code>teracy-chef</code> and <code>teracy-dev</code>, we&rsquo;ll support provisioning the servers
with <code>knife-solo</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>And we&rsquo;ll also support many different types of operating systems for the base boxes, even with
Windows base boxes.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to continue developing and releasing the next versions.</p>
