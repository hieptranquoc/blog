<p>About six months ago we published
<a href="/2016/09/22/how-to-develop-angular-2-applications-easily-with-docker-and-angular-cli/">How to Develop Angular 2 Applications Easily With Docker and Angular-cli</a> which received a lot of
Angular community feedbacks and questions.</p>

<p>Six months has passed and we&rsquo;d like to share more best practices to develop Angular applications with
Docker after working on it for a while.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Received Feedbacks</h2>

<p>We received some outstanding feedbacks and questions about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Problems when running Docker images after pulling the built Docker images.</li>
<li>How to build prod Docker image and run it.</li>
<li>How to get <code>npm</code> packages into the <code>node_modules</code> to work within your IDE, editor.</li>
</ul>


<p>And in this blog post, we&rsquo;re going to solve all of them and even with more best practices.</p>

<h2>angular-boilerplate</h2>

<p>Setting up Angular projects with Docker to get it work properly is not easy. Luckily, we&rsquo;ve done
all the heavy lifting for you with the <code>angular-boilerplate</code> project.</p>

<p><code>angular-boilerplate</code> was created as a seed project that can be used to generate any new Angular
projects having Docker and CI/CD system support.</p>

<p>To generate a new Angular project, you can check out the
<a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/angular-boilerplate/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> file to follow.</p>

<h2>angular-hello-world</h2>

<p>In this section, I&rsquo;ll introduce you the best way to set up a development environment and you can apply
it for all your projects, not just Angular projects. After some first required steps to set up
<code>acme-dev</code>, after <code>$ vagrant up</code>, you can start coding immediately, you don&rsquo;t have to learn the set
up steps at first, but defer it later.</p>

<p>Suppose that we&rsquo;re in Acme organization and we need to work on the <code>angular-hello-world</code> project.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s follow the README file here: <a href="https://github.com/acme101/angular-hello-world">https://github.com/acme101/angular-hello-world</a></p>

<p>It tells us to follow <a href="https://github.com/acme101/dev-setup/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/acme101/dev-setup/blob/master/README.md</a></p>

<p>By setting up <code>acme-dev</code>, we can use it for all types of projects with different stacks with the same
set up workflow, it means that we can save a lot of time and effort to add more and more projects.</p>

<p>Re-using and scaling boots productivity and cost savings.</p>

<h2>Best practices</h2>

<p>By looking into the <code>angular-boilerplate</code> or <code>angular-hello-world</code>, you can see the following best
practices:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We should build the production Docker image for production deployment.</p></li>
<li><p>We should work on dev mode on local dev.</p></li>
<li><p>We should work on prod mode on local dev.</p></li>
<li><p>We should review others' work on local dev.</p></li>
<li><p>We should use alias domains instead of fixed ports to avoid conflicts.</p></li>
<li><p>We should generate <code>node_modules</code> to work on the npm packages safely within your IDE.</p></li>
<li><p>We should use <code>yarn</code> instead <code>npm</code> as the node package manager.</p></li>
<li><p>We should test both dev and prod modes on local dev.</p></li>
<li><p>We should test both http and https modes on local dev.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All the instruction should be updated in the README file, please follow there to apply for your
project: <a href="https://github.com/acme101/angular-hello-world/blob/develop/README.md">https://github.com/acme101/angular-hello-world/blob/develop/README.md</a></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>All the heavy lifting and best practices are documented into the corresponding projects, that&rsquo;s how
we should do so that everyone can follow easily and we can support each other with ease, too.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this will help you a lot with your Angular projects and any other projects that you can
apply similarly.</p>

<p>Happy hacking and don&rsquo;t forget to let us know your feedbacks and questions by leaving your comments!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.teracy.com/2017/02/14/teracy-dev-v0-5-0-b1-release/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-14T12:41:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.teracy.com/2017/02/14/teracy-dev-v0-5-0-b1-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re very happy to announce our so long awaiting major release of teracy-dev, the v0.5.0-b1 release
that introduces lots of features and changes, high performance with Docker workflow as the default.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>v0.5.0-b1</h2>

<p>This is the beta 1 release of v0.5.0, what does it mean? By following the
<a href="http://dev.teracy.org/docs/semantic_versioning.html">semantic versioning guide</a>, it means:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>features completed, only minor bugs are expected. Avoid refactoring here, just fix bugs</p></blockquote></p>

<p>This v0.5.0-b1 release is tested with all our projects and our clients' projects, so we can guarantee
that the release has a very high quality and stability that you can use it for everyday projects.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still lacking lots of documentation guides for users to explore and leverage all the supported
features more easily.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>This major release includes lots of features and improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>high performance on Windows, especially file syncing</li>
<li>Docker workflow out of the box, can use any versions of docker, docker-compose</li>
<li>support all type of provisioners configurations</li>
<li>use public_network by default</li>
<li>config override the object within array</li>
<li>Vagrantfile-ext support</li>
<li>use rsync as the default sync mechanism (with the support from vagrant-gatling-rsync and
vagrant-rsync-back plugins)</li>
<li>reverse proxy support with /etc/hosts update for auto domain management</li>
<li>auto vagrant plugins installation support</li>
</ul>


<p>There are more that you should explore yourselves when using <code>teracy-dev</code> for a while.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re working hard to add more documentations and guides. We&rsquo;ll fix bugs if any.</p>

<p>After v0.5.0 final is release, we&rsquo;ll take on the next major release v0.6.0 that follow our
<a href="/2016/08/19/teracy-dev-vision/">teracy-dev&rsquo;s vision</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>teracy-dev is the best universal development tool for everyone.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll take all the feedback from v0.5.0 usage to continue making <code>teracy-dev</code> better and greater.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to use <a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/dev">teracy-dev v0.5.0-b1</a> for your everyday
projects from today by getting started with <a href="http://dev.teracy.org/docs/getting_started.html">http://dev.teracy.org/docs/getting_started.html</a></p>

<p>If you have any feedbacks or problems, you&rsquo;re welcome to create issues for the project at

    <id>http://blog.teracy.com/2016/12/20/teracy-dev-the-only-truly-universal-productive-development-platform-with-docker-on-macos-linux-and-windows</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Docker is great to work with, it solves a lot of problems on development, distribution, and production
deployment.</p>

<p>Why Docker?  You can find the answer here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://thenewstack.io/why-did-docker-catch-on-quickly-and-why-is-it-so-interesting/">http://thenewstack.io/why-did-docker-catch-on-quickly-and-why-is-it-so-interesting/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thenewstack.io/hypervisors-container-era/">http://thenewstack.io/hypervisors-container-era/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.codeship.com/why-docker/">https://blog.codeship.com/why-docker/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Docker works great on Linux, however, it&rsquo;s very challenging to make it work universal and consistent on
Mac and Windows. There are lots of efforts to solve this problem, from Docker themselves and from
Docker community, too. However, we haven&rsquo;t achieved that stage yet (until <code>teracy-dev</code>).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>These are some of the problems that Docker community has to deal with on Mac and Windows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No consistent universal development environment and workflow on Linux, Windows, Mac. This is a very
important factor for team collaboration so that anyone from any OS platforms could collaborate and help
each other with no differences in the development environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Mounted volumes on VirtualBox use vboxsf, which is extremely slow. This is true for Boot2Docker and
Vagrant default file sync mechanism on Virtualbox.</p></li>
<li><p>Native Docker applications offered by Docker:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow on Mac: <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77">https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77</a></li>
<li>Only recent latest versions of Window 10 (&ldquo;Build 10586 or later&rdquo;) are supported</li>
<li>Slow on Windows: <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/188">https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/188</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>File watching is broken on VirtualBox since vboxsf does not trigger the inotify file watching
mechanism. <code>nodemon</code>, hello?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are a lot of Docker community projects trying to solve those problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev">https://github.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant">https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy">https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leighmcculloch/docker-unison">https://github.com/leighmcculloch/docker-unison</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gansbrest/hodor">https://github.com/gansbrest/hodor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs">https://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs</a></li>
<li>others&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>However, those existing projects do not really resolve all the problems or do not reflect
our vision for a productive development platform.</p>

<p>You can check out our <a href="/2016/08/19/teracy-dev-vision/">vision for teracy-dev</a> for such the
productive development platform.</p>

<p>That is the reason why we created <code>teracy-dev</code>. We&rsquo;ve been using and loving it for more than 3 years
and counting.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> reflects our vision for a truly universal productive development platform that anyone can
use to develop software easily. It&rsquo;s very easy to customize any OS that you can use
for your VM. It brings development and production environment closer and closer.</p>

<p>It is very important for a distributed team like us to work with everyone from different teams all
over the world on different projects with different stacks and <code>teracy-dev</code> helps us a lot.</p>

<p>Moreover, <code>teracy-dev</code> is not tightly coupled with anything, you&rsquo;re free to choose anything to build
up your development VM machine. You can choose different OS platforms, choose different software packages to
be automatically installed with the help of different configuration management tools. It&rsquo;s up
to you to choose anything other than default settings.</p>

<p>With default settings, <code>teracy-dev</code> chooses Ubuntu as the base OS with <code>docker</code> and <code>docker-compose</code>
installed to start developing software with Docker right away after <code>$ vagrant up</code>.</p>

<p>teracy-dev v0.5.0 is leveraging Docker for development as we believe in the future of containers
and Docker.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have some comparisons between <code>teracy-dev</code> and other solutions:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>   Criteria                         </th>
<th> teracy-dev </th>
<th> docker-osx-dev </th>
<th> Docker Toolbox </th>
<th> Docker native app</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>same workflow on Linux, Mac, Windows</td>

<td>     🚫        </td>
<td>       ❌          </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>✅: fully support</p>

<p>❌: no or partial support</p>

<p>🚫: can be achieved but not encouraged</p>

<p>Let me explain the criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;same workflow on Linux, Mac, Windows&rdquo;: the usage should be the same on Mac, Linux, Windows.
Docker native app only supports >= Windows 10, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s marked as ❌.</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;native speed on mounted volumes&rdquo;: the speed should be as fast and native as on Linux</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;2-way file sync&rdquo;: for syncing back and forth on mounted volumes, this is mandatory for development</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;file watching (inotify)&rdquo;: for auto reload when files change</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;customization&rdquo;: you have full control and are encouraged to change anything that you want to
suit your need, no hidden stuff, no lock-in and can still upgrade seamlessly.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see what the same workflow means when developing a simple hello world <code>nodejs</code> application
from scratch with teracy-dev by watching the following videos:</p>

<p>On Linux (Ubuntu):</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ze8p9imprgk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>On Windows:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2200zvxIdAs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>On macOS:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF-FQQKG8PA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>They all contain the same steps, that&rsquo;s the meaning of the &ldquo;same workflow&rdquo;.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> is not perfect, though. There are some improvements that we&rsquo;d like to address.</p>

<p>The first thing we&rsquo;d like to improve is to reduce the setup time. It takes time (around 20-30 mins)
to download the vagrant box (Ubuntu 16.04) for the first time. This is for the first time only, however.
After the first time, you can destroy and provision the same VM within some minutes. We could use
some other smaller boxes (for example, boot2docker base box) but we&rsquo;d like to stick to the most popular
Linux OS that is widely used in production. We try to make development and production environment as
close as possible. This is by default, you can choose different base boxes as you wish.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> v0.5.0 is under preview stage, we need to add more documentation and get more community
feedback.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> is created to give back to open source community as we learn and get a lot from our amazing
open source community.</p>

<p>And we need you, please try and let us know your feedback and we&rsquo;ll together fix any problems.</p>

<p>You should get started with <code>teracy-dev</code> here: <a href="http://dev.teracy.org/docs/develop/getting_started.html">http://dev.teracy.org/docs/develop/getting_started.html</a></p>

<p>In summary, <code>teracy-dev</code> brings <code>Docker</code> closer to <code>Vagrant</code> = love.</p>

<p>Thank you and happy hacking with <a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/dev">teracy-dev</a>!</p>

    <updated>2016-08-19T16:27:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.teracy.com/2016/08/19/teracy-dev-vision</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>teracy-dev has been being developed and in use from the first days of Teracy, it&rsquo;s been
about 3 years<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> now. We&rsquo;re in a hurry for a really big, exciting release for the next version of
teracy-dev. I&rsquo;d like to take this chance to share with you about teracy-dev vision first and many
other new features and improvements for the next long awaiting teracy-dev release.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Let&rsquo;s get started with a story about my first working days as a developer when joining my first
company 8 years ago. As developers, it&rsquo;s expected that we should have our development environment
ready before starting coding. At that time, my company used Maven to build Java projects and I was
required to install it. However, as a junior, I had difficulties to install it on the Ubuntu
computer provided to me. I struggled with it for nearly a day and eventually I had to ask for
help to install it successfully. This is a true story. Now I can even install it in just some
minutes with a few lines of commands because I have more experience.</p>

<p>Now just imagine what if juniors don&rsquo;t have to set up these boring tools each by each but just enjoy
coding, that&rsquo;s the more fun part. What if all developers should have the same development environment
even they use different kinds of operating systems so that we don&rsquo;t have to deal with the very common
problem: &ldquo;But it works on my machine&rdquo;. What if the production environment is easily set up exactly
the same on a developer machine to debug and fix things and vice versa?</p>

<p>These what ifs lead us to use <code>vagrant</code> as the base to complete these things as the first days of
Teracy journey. We&rsquo;d like to upgrade the vagrant dev environment easily, for example, <code>$ git pull</code>
then <code>$ vagrant reload --provision</code> and you&rsquo;re done. We have default configuration and we could
override it easily. We&rsquo;d like to use this development environment for all our projects: from our
internal projects to our clients' projects.</p>

<p>We created teracy-dev to solve the mentioned problems above, help boost our productivity and it could
even help us more than that. Everyone just enjoys it, we don&rsquo;t have to deal with installing things
manually, it&rsquo;s auto provided with just one command (<code>$ vagrant up</code>) thanks to the provision software.
We&rsquo;re using Chef to provision but we can use others to provision, too, for example Ansible, Puppet, etc.</p>

<p>We see that teracy-dev is so useful for developers, so we&rsquo;d like to share it, shape its future
together with anyone who wants to work with software. And we envision teracy-dev with the following
statement:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>teracy-dev is the best universal development tool for everyone.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s our vision for teracy-dev as the base development platform and we&rsquo;re going to make it true.
Note that it should be used for everyone, even with our QA engineers, with our manual testers, with
our employees, with our users as long as they follow exactly a little setup instruction guide.</p>

<p>I believe that everyone should use it as much as we enjoy using and developing it. It&rsquo;s been saving
us and our clients a lot of money as we don&rsquo;t have to spend the time to set up development environment
for each and every project manually.</p>

<p>We improve it day by day though our projects, we listen to our developers, our clients for feedback
on usage and development. However, we still have some problems with it. For example, on Windows, the
file sharing system is really slow. It&rsquo;s not really lightweight and modular enough to serve every
project&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<p>We know all these problems and we&rsquo;re going to fix these all with the next version by leveraging
Docker and Rsync. We intended to use Docker for long, we expected it should be in use since
teracy-dev v0.4.0 but we failed to make it. Now we promise you that teracy-dev v0.5.0 will leverage
Docker as the core workflow and it will rule the world of developers.</p>

<p>We will add more documentation for usage, accelerate the development pace so that you should benefit
from it as we do. Let&rsquo;s try using it once with
<a href="http://dev.teracy.org/docs/0.4.2/getting_started.html">teracy-dev v0.4.2</a>, it&rsquo;s open source and
totally free. You will love it as we do now for 3 years and counting. Let&rsquo;s together make it better
and better and better.</p>
